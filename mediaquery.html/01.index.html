        The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser
        and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example
        "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of
        responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts
        depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to
        detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for
        example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. In
        this lesson you will first learn about the syntax used in media queries,
        and then move on to use them in a working example showing how a simple
        design might be made responsive.
